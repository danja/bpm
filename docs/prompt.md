"I want to build a real-time BPM finder app using Flutter. Please provide a clear and modular architecture for the app and detailed step-by-step instructions for implementation. The app should:

Capture audio input from the device microphone in real time.

Process the audio stream to detect beats using signal processing techniques such as onset detection and autocorrelation.

Calculate the BPM dynamically and update the UI continuously.

Handle noise and irregularities in rhythm for robust BPM detection.

Follow best practices for code organization including separation of UI, audio processing, and state management.

Include explanations of key algorithmic steps and how to integrate any required Flutter or native libraries for audio input and processing.

Please provide a detailed plan covering the architecture, main components, algorithms to use, and example Flutter code snippets to get started."

This prompt clarifies the goal, core features, and architectural expectations for the AI assistant to generate a well-structured and guided BPM finder implementation in Flutter.

To summarize, using onset detection plus autocorrelation are effective algorithmic approaches for real-time BPM detection, and the provided prompt instructs an AI assistant on building the app with a clean, stepwise Flutter architecture to handle audio input, processing, and UI updates with solid BPM estimation techniques
