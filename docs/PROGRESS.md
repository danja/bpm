# Progress Log

Chronological record of major milestones. Times in UTC. Keep entries concise; link to PRs or docs when available.

| Timestamp | Agent | Summary | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-10-25 14:19:55Z | Solution Architect (AI) | Reviewed `docs/PLAN-01.md`, captured roles in `AGENTS.md`, set up progress tracking structure. | Spin up Flutter project skeleton aligned with layered architecture. |
| 2025-10-25 14:26:03Z | App Platform Engineer (AI) | Scaffolded Flutter project files, algorithm interfaces, coordinator, repository, Cubit, and baseline UI per PLAN-01 architecture. | Hook up real microphone testing, add Wavelet/FFT algorithms, and validation harnesses. |
| 2025-10-25 14:38:57Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Added FFT and wavelet algorithms, registry wiring, signal utilities, and synthetic-signal tests validating tempo accuracy. | Run `flutter test` once SDK is available; iterate on accuracy tuning with real audio captures. |
| 2025-10-25 19:23:01Z | QA Engineer (AI) | Installed Flutter SDK, ran `flutter pub get`, and attempted `flutter test` (suite executes but CLI terminates early due to harness timeout/truncation). | Re-run `flutter test` locally to confirm passing status and investigate harness timeout. |
| 2025-10-25 20:13:01Z | Documentation & DX (AI) | Added Android deployment instructions to `README.md` covering tooling, USB setup, `flutter run`, and APK build/install steps. | Follow up with signing guidance once release pipeline is in place. |
| 2025-10-25 20:35:23Z | Flutter UI Engineer (AI) | Introduced BPM history tracking, previous-value deltas, and a sparkline trend widget so incremental improvements are visible in-app; documented the feature in `README.md`. | Stabilize wavelet accuracy tests (currently off by ~13 BPM) and ensure `flutter test` passes end-to-end. |
| 2025-10-25 20:45:43Z | Platform Engineer (AI) | Ran `flutter create .` to add full Android/iOS/web/desktop scaffolding, fetched deps, and documented supported platforms so the GUI can build on real devices. | Run `flutter doctor` + `flutter test` on a host machine to confirm environment health. |
| 2025-10-30 00:00:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer + Solution Architect (AI) | Analyzed current algorithm failures (FFT ARM crash, Autocorrelation timeout, Wavelet compute-bound) and preprocessing gaps. Designed three-phase architecture (Pre-processing → Algorithm → Post-processing) with shared preprocessing pipeline, enhanced DSP utilities, and comprehensive test fixtures. Documented in `docs/PLAN-02.md`. | Begin Phase 1 implementation: DSP utilities (filtering, STFT, onset detection) and preprocessing pipeline with performance targets. |
