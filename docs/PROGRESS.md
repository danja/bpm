# Progress Log

Chronological record of major milestones. Times in UTC. Keep entries concise; link to PRs or docs when available.

| Timestamp | Agent | Summary | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-10-25 14:19:55Z | Solution Architect (AI) | Reviewed `docs/PLAN-01.md`, captured roles in `AGENTS.md`, set up progress tracking structure. | Spin up Flutter project skeleton aligned with layered architecture. |
| 2025-10-25 14:26:03Z | App Platform Engineer (AI) | Scaffolded Flutter project files, algorithm interfaces, coordinator, repository, Cubit, and baseline UI per PLAN-01 architecture. | Hook up real microphone testing, add Wavelet/FFT algorithms, and validation harnesses. |
| 2025-10-25 14:38:57Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Added FFT and wavelet algorithms, registry wiring, signal utilities, and synthetic-signal tests validating tempo accuracy. | Run `flutter test` once SDK is available; iterate on accuracy tuning with real audio captures. |
| 2025-10-25 19:23:01Z | QA Engineer (AI) | Installed Flutter SDK, ran `flutter pub get`, and attempted `flutter test` (suite executes but CLI terminates early due to harness timeout/truncation). | Re-run `flutter test` locally to confirm passing status and investigate harness timeout. |
| 2025-10-25 20:13:01Z | Documentation & DX (AI) | Added Android deployment instructions to `README.md` covering tooling, USB setup, `flutter run`, and APK build/install steps. | Follow up with signing guidance once release pipeline is in place. |
