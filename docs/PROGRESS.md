| Timestamp | Agent | Summary | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-10-25 14:19:55Z | Solution Architect (AI) | Reviewed `docs/PLAN-01.md`, captured roles in `AGENTS.md`, set up progress tracking structure. | Spin up Flutter project skeleton aligned with layered architecture. |
| 2025-10-25 14:26:03Z | App Platform Engineer (AI) | Scaffolded Flutter project files, algorithm interfaces, coordinator, repository, Cubit, and baseline UI per PLAN-01 architecture. | Hook up real microphone testing, add Wavelet/FFT algorithms, and validation harnesses. |
| 2025-10-25 14:38:57Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Added FFT and wavelet algorithms, registry wiring, signal utilities, and synthetic-signal tests validating tempo accuracy. | Run `flutter test` once SDK is available; iterate on accuracy tuning with real audio captures. |
| 2025-10-25 19:23:01Z | QA Engineer (AI) | Installed Flutter SDK, ran `flutter pub get`, and attempted `flutter test` (suite executes but CLI terminates early due to harness timeout/truncation). | Re-run `flutter test` locally to confirm passing status and investigate harness timeout. |
| 2025-10-25 20:13:01Z | Documentation & DX (AI) | Added Android deployment instructions to `README.md` covering tooling, USB setup, `flutter run`, and APK build/install steps. | Follow up with signing guidance once release pipeline is in place. |
| 2025-10-25 20:35:23Z | Flutter UI Engineer (AI) | Introduced BPM history tracking, previous-value deltas, and a sparkline trend widget so incremental improvements are visible in-app; documented the feature in `README.md`. | Stabilize wavelet accuracy tests (currently off by ~13 BPM) and ensure `flutter test` passes end-to-end. |
| 2025-10-25 20:45:43Z | Platform Engineer (AI) | Ran `flutter create .` to add full Android/iOS/web/desktop scaffolding, fetched deps, and documented supported platforms so the GUI can build on real devices. | Run `flutter doctor` + `flutter test` on a host machine to confirm environment health. |
| 2025-10-30 00:00:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer + Solution Architect (AI) | Analyzed current algorithm failures (FFT ARM crash, Autocorrelation timeout, Wavelet compute-bound) and preprocessing gaps. Designed three-phase architecture (Pre-processing → Algorithm → Post-processing) with shared preprocessing pipeline, enhanced DSP utilities, and comprehensive test fixtures. Documented in `docs/PLAN-02.md`. | Begin Phase 1 implementation: DSP utilities (filtering, STFT, onset detection) and preprocessing pipeline with performance targets. |
| 2025-10-30 01:00:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | **Implemented PLAN-02 Phase 1 & 2**: Created preprocessing pipeline with normalization, filtering, onset detection, STFT utilities. Updated all 4 algorithms to use shared preprocessing (eliminating redundant computations). Optimized WaveletEnergyAlgorithm from 4→2 levels. Updated coordinator to run preprocessing once per cycle. All algorithms now receive PreprocessedSignal. Tests updated and passing. Build verified with `flutter analyze` - no errors. | Test on device to verify: 1) All algorithms execute without crashes/timeouts, 2) Performance improvements (preprocessing <500ms, algorithms within targets), 3) FFT ARM crash resolved, 4) Wavelet completes in <5s. |
| 2025-10-30 02:00:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | **Implemented PLAN-02 Phase 3 (Post-Processing)**: Created `EnhancedConsensusEngine` with temporal tracking (15-reading history), outlier rejection using MAD (Median Absolute Deviation), progressive convergence with adaptive smoothing (0.15-0.5 factor based on stability), trend detection via mode analysis, and confidence boosting for recurring values. Engine progressively homes in on stable BPM, rejects glitches >2.5 MAD, and finds patterns in noisy readings. Wired into app via `ConsensusInterface`. Build verified - no errors. | Deploy to device and observe: 1) BPM should stabilize over time rather than jumping, 2) Outlier readings should be rejected, 3) Consensus should converge to recurring values, 4) Display should show smooth trends. |
| 2025-10-30 03:00:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | **Refined Phase 3 with Robust Majority Logic**: Created `RobustConsensusEngine` with per-algorithm tracking, individual outlier rejection (8 BPM threshold per algorithm's own median), and true majority voting via clustering. Each algorithm maintains its own 10-reading history; outliers are rejected within each stream independently. Consensus uses clustering (3 BPM tolerance) to find groups of agreeing algorithms, then majority vote selects winning cluster. Requires minimum 2 algorithms agreeing. This prevents averaging of conflicting values - only self-consistent algorithms contribute to final BPM. Build verified - no errors. | Test on device: Individual algorithm streams should be stable, outliers rejected per-algorithm, consensus should reflect majority agreement rather than average of all readings. |
| 2025-10-30 09:03:46Z | Test & QA Engineer (AI) | Evaluated Linux-based WAV test rig requirements and documented plan covering decoding, fixture manifest, CLI harness, and automation strategy (`docs/linux-wav-test-rig.md`). | Acquire fixtures, add WAV decoder dependency, and implement `tool/bpm_wav_benchmark.dart` + `WavFileAudioStreamSource`. |
| 2025-10-30 09:15:11Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Enforced 50–250 BPM bounds across detection algorithms with shared harmonic helpers, added mel-spectrum features to preprocessing, and recalibrated `RobustConsensusEngine` confidence/octave handling based on stability metrics. | Exercise new consensus stability logic with live captures; profile mel preprocessing cost on target devices. |
| 2025-10-30 11:07:06Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Reworked `SimpleOnsetAlgorithm` with shared harmonic clustering, applied the refinement engine to autocorrelation/FFT/wavelet detectors, and updated the consensus engine with weighted clustering + metadata-aware confidence. Expanded synthetic regression suite (click tracks, complex rhythms, noisy beats) to guard against octave regressions. | Run `flutter test` to capture updated baselines and compare confidence trends against real recordings. |
| 2025-10-30 12:45:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Authored PLAN-03 outlining interval histograms, metadata-weighted consensus, WAV fixture validation, and UI telemetry roadmap for accuracy stabilization. Implemented first pass: bucket-based onset clustering, shared harmonic metadata propagation across algorithms, new metronome WAV integration tests, and consensus weighting using per-reading metadata. | Iterate on interval histogram weighting (focus on fundamental selection), extend regression harness to additional fixtures, and calibrate confidence tiers against WAV results. |
| 2025-10-30 13:30:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Shifted SimpleOnset tempo selection to duration-squared histogram bins with aggressive harmonic penalties, added fundamental tie-breakers favouring slower buckets, and refreshed PLAN-03 to reflect Week-1 progress. Teed up architecture/algorithms docs plus README links. | Extend histogram weighting to Autocorrelation, retune penalties using WAV fixtures, and land consensus confidence tiers. |
| 2025-10-30 15:45:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Completed Phase A algorithm tuning: autocorrelation now runs on the onset envelope with calibrated confidence, FFT adds a fundamental guard, and the wavelet detector operates on the 400 Hz feed with faster convergence. Metronome WAV suite now passes for all detectors in ~3 s. | Begin consensus weighting refresh (Phase B) and capture confidence semantics adjustments in documentation. |
| 2025-10-30 16:30:00Z | DSP & Algorithms Engineer (AI) | Implemented tempogram generation from the novelty curve, exposing tempo/time axes, dominant tempo trace, and integration tests. Preprocessing now ships tempogram snapshots for upcoming UI/consensus work. | Wire dominant tempo data into consensus metadata and prototype PLP-informed consensus features (PLAN-03 Phase B). |
