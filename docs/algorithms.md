# BPM Detection Algorithms

This document summarizes the signal-processing approaches currently implemented in the Flutter BPM Detection tool. Each section links the practical implementation choices in `lib/src/algorithms` with the canonical techniques they were derived from so new contributors understand the trade-offs.

## Layered Overview

1. **Audio Capture & Preprocessing** — `RecordAudioStreamSource` pulls mono float frames from the microphone, normalizes them, and hands them to the coordinator in fixed windows (`AudioStreamConfig`).
2. **Algorithm Registry** — `AlgorithmRegistry` fans each sliding window into multiple detection strategies (`SimpleOnsetAlgorithm`, `AutocorrelationAlgorithm`, `FftSpectrumAlgorithm`, `WaveletEnergyAlgorithm`). Each implementation owns its preferred window size and emits a `BpmReading`.
3. **Consensus Engine** — `ConsensusEngine` weights algorithm outputs by confidence and recency before surfacing a single `ConsensusResult`. This keeps the UI stable even if any one method momentarily misfires.

## Energy Onset (Transient) Detection

- **Implementation**: `lib/src/algorithms/simple_onset_algorithm.dart`
- **Idea**: Converts time-domain samples into short-time energy envelopes, thresholds local peaks, and converts inter-peak intervals into BPM estimates.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Flatten all frames, compute frame energy (`samples²` summed over `frameMillis` windows).
  - Normalize the envelope, keep peaks above 0.6 relative amplitude.
  - **PLAN‑03 Week 1**: build duration-weighted histograms of inter-peak intervals (20 ms bins), down-weight faster harmonics, and normalize the winning bucket into the `[minBpm, maxBpm]` range.
  - Confidence blends inter-beat variance with histogram agreement (bucket strength/supporter ratio).
- **References**:
  - D. Ellis, *“Beat Tracking by Dynamic Programming,”* ISMIR 2007 — describes transient-based beat inference.
  - A. Brossier, *“Automatic Annotation of Musical Audio for Interactive Applications,”* PhD thesis, 2006 — foundation for energy-based onset detection.

**Usage Notes**: Works best on percussive material with clear kick/snare accents. Adjust `frameMillis` for finer temporal precision (smaller windows) or better noise resistance (larger windows). Provide realistic `DetectionContext` bounds—the histogram normalizes to the closest BPM inside that window.

## Autocorrelation (Time-Domain Periodicity)

- **Implementation**: `lib/src/algorithms/autocorrelation_algorithm.dart`
- **Idea**: Classic time-domain autocorrelation scanning for periodicities consistent with target BPM range.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Normalize flattened samples to [-1, 1].
  - Compute autocorrelation for lags between `minLag` and `maxLag` derived from `minBpm/maxBpm`.
  - Pick the lag with max correlation, convert to BPM.
  - Confidence equals normalized autocorrelation score.
- **References**:
  - E. D. Scheirer, *“Tempo and Beat Analysis of Acoustic Musical Signals,”* JASA 103(1), 1998.
  - F. Gouyon & S. Dixon, *“A Review of Automatic Rhythm Description Systems,”* Computer Music Journal 29(1), 2005.

**Usage Notes**: Sensitive to strong harmonics; pre-normalization and tight lag bounds reduce octave errors. Consider downsampling long windows to shrink the search space if performance becomes a concern.

> PLAN‑03 Week 1 follow-up will import the interval histogram weighting used by the onset detector so autocorrelation favours fundamental lags when multiple harmonics compete.

## FFT Magnitude Spectrum

- **Implementation**: `lib/src/algorithms/fft_spectrum_algorithm.dart` (runtime FFT in `lib/src/dsp/fft_utils.dart`)
- **Idea**: Frequency-domain approach that identifies dominant low-frequency peaks in the magnitude spectrum of the energy envelope.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Normalize samples, zero-pad to the next power-of-two >= window length.
  - Apply Hann window to reduce spectral leakage.
  - Downsample to ~16 kHz, Hann window, and run the in-app radix-2 FFT helper (`FftUtils.magnitudeSpectrum`) to recover the low-frequency beat envelope.
  - Translate bin index to BPM (`frequency * 60`), track strongest magnitude inside `[minBpm, maxBpm]`.
  - Confidence compares peak magnitude with average spectral energy.
- **References**:
  - G. Tzanetakis & P. Cook, *“Musical Genre Classification of Audio Signals,”* IEEE TASLP 10(5), 2002 — uses spectral periodicity for rhythm features.
  - A. Klapuri et al., *“Multipitch Analysis of Harmonic Sound Signals Based on Spectral Flattening and Subharmonic Summation,”* IEEE TASLP 11(6), 2003 — foundational for harmonic sum approaches.

**Usage Notes**: Works well on steady-state dance tracks. Ensure `fftSize` spans at least 8–12 seconds to get sub-1 BPM resolution when targeting low tempos.

## Wavelet Energy Bands + Aggregation

- **Implementation**: `lib/src/algorithms/wavelet_energy_algorithm.dart`
- **Idea**: Applies a multiresolution Haar transform, analyzes detail-band energy envelopes, and aggregates candidate periodicities to improve robustness on noisy material.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Normalize and trim audio to a power-of-two length.
  - Perform iterative Haar decomposition, storing detail bands up to `levels`.
  - For each detail level:
    - Compute absolute energy, smooth with adaptive windows, remove DC, normalize.
    - Upsample to match original length and accumulate weighted envelopes (`1/scale` weighting).
    - Run autocorrelation within BPM-aware lag bounds; track best lag per level with scale-aware weighting.
  - Combine best per-level candidate with the aggregated (averaged) envelope.
  - Fallback: If both disagree or are out-of-range, analyze a high-resolution absolute envelope of the raw signal.
  - Metadata captures whether aggregate/fallback logic overrode the level-specific pick, aiding debugging.

  - M. E. P. Davies & M. D. Plumbley, *“Context-Dependent Beat Tracking of Musical Audio,”* IEEE TASLP 15(3), 2007 — multiband energy tracking with autocorrelation consensus.
  - S. Mallat, *“A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing,”* Academic Press, 2008 — general background on wavelet coefficient interpretation.

**Usage Notes**: Tunable parameters include number of levels, smoothing windows, and weighting heuristics. Increasing levels improves sensitivity to slower tempos but raises compute cost.

## Consensus & Confidence Handling

- **Implementation**: `lib/src/core/consensus_engine.dart`
- **Approach**: Weighted median of available BPM readings, with weights derived from:
  - Reported confidences (normalized per algorithm).
  - Temporal decay (recent readings counted more heavily).
  - Known performance tiers (e.g., Wavelet + FFT considered more reliable on polyphonic material than raw onset).
- **References**:
  - A. Holzapfel & Y. Stylianou, *“Beat Tracking using Joint Beat and Rhythm Salience,”* IEEE TASLP 19(1), 2011 — demonstrates combining heterogeneous rhythmic cues.
  - J. McGraw & R. Fiebrink, *“Systematic Evaluation of Real-Time Beat Trackers,”* NIME 2014 — motivates multi-algorithm fusion.

## Future Work & Extensions

- **Probabilistic Tempo Models**: Incorporate tempo dynamics (e.g., particle filters or Bayesian tempo trackers as in Bello & Ellis 2005) to smooth per-window jitter.
- **Neural Frontends**: Replace handcrafted features with lightweight CNN onset detectors (`Madmom`-style) when NN inference is viable on-device.
- **Adaptive Buffering**: Allow algorithms to request longer windows (e.g., 20–30 s) when confidences remain low, trading latency for accuracy.
