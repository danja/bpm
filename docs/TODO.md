  ☑ Add BPM range constraints (50-250) to all algorithms (`lib/src/algorithms/*`)
  ☑ Fix confidence to reflect reading stability instead of algorithm weights (`lib/src/core/robust_consensus_engine.dart`)
  ☑ Improve octave error correction in consensus engines (`lib/src/core/robust_consensus_engine.dart`)
  ☑ Add mel-spectrum preprocessing for perceptually-relevant frequency focus (`lib/src/dsp/preprocessing_pipeline.dart`)

☑ Evaluate what would be involved in setting up a test rig built for linux for testing the algorithms on data from .wav files containing real music (see `docs/linux-wav-test-rig.md`)
