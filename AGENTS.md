# BPM Detection Tool ‚Äî Agent Context Guide

This document provides essential context for AI agents and contributors working on the Flutter BPM detection codebase. It consolidates key information from README, PLAN-03, algorithms.md, and PROGRESS.md to help agents understand the project state, architecture, and current focus areas.

## Project Overview

Real-time Flutter application that captures microphone audio and runs multiple BPM detection algorithms (energy onset, autocorrelation, FFT spectrum, Haar-wavelet aggregation). The architecture follows a layered approach: UI ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Algorithms ‚Üí DSP ‚Üí Audio I/O.

**Build-upload-test cycle takes a long time; plan ahead and make every revision count.**

## Current Project State (as of 2025-10-31)

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Four complementary detectors implemented and passing tests
- ‚úÖ Preprocessing pipeline with shared novelty curve, onset envelope, STFT, and tempogram
- ‚úÖ Tempogram/PLP integration: preprocessing publishes tempogram snapshots and PLP readings
- ‚úÖ Real-time UI with consensus card, delta indicator, sparkline history, elapsed timer, and PLP panel
- ‚úÖ Platform plumbing via `record` 6.x for microphone streaming

### Current Issues & Focus Areas
- **Wavelet Algorithm**: Generally accurate but tolerance handling has issues
  - `percentTolerance` not applying correctly in tests; still showing old fixed tolerance in failure messages
  - Need debug prints for computed allowed tolerance to verify test execution values
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Not currently very good; needs metadata-weighted improvements (PLAN-03 Phase B)
- **Predominant Pulse (PLP)**: Recently added, needs proper integration to make UI consistent
- **Test Infrastructure**: Using synthesized audio and data files under `data/` (metronome_55.wav, metronome_105.wav, metronome_155.wav, metronome_205.wav)

### Active Development (PLAN-03 Week 1)
- Interval histogram refinement with duration-weighted bins and harmonic penalties
- Per-reading metadata (bucket scores, multipliers, supporter counts) surfaced to consensus
- Histogram weighting + harmonic suppression in Autocorrelation and FFT
- Wavelet downsampled to 400 Hz with confidence remapping

## Architecture Layers

1. **Audio Capture & Preprocessing** ‚Äî `RecordAudioStreamSource` pulls mono float frames, normalizes them, hands to coordinator in fixed windows
2. **Preprocessing Pipeline** (`lib/src/dsp/preprocessing.dart`) ‚Äî Generates `PreprocessedSignal` with:
   - Normalized samples
   - Onset novelty curve (~100 Hz)
   - STFT data
   - Tempogram (tempo-time heatmap) with PLP trace
3. **Algorithm Registry** (`lib/src/algorithms/`) ‚Äî Four detectors process `PreprocessedSignal`:
   - `SimpleOnsetAlgorithm` ‚Äî Energy envelope with duration-weighted histograms
   - `AutocorrelationAlgorithm` ‚Äî Time-domain periodicity on onset envelope
   - `FftSpectrumAlgorithm` ‚Äî Frequency-domain with fundamental guard
   - `WaveletEnergyAlgorithm` ‚Äî Multiresolution Haar transform (400 Hz, 2 levels)
4. **Consensus Engine** (`lib/src/core/consensus_engine.dart`) ‚Äî Weighted median of readings plus PLP vote, considers:
   - Confidence, cluster consistency, algorithm coverage
   - Harmonic correction flags (reduce weight for median/boundary/octave adjustments)
   - PLP strength (auxiliary vote when primary detectors disagree)
5. **Coordinator** (`lib/src/core/bpm_detector_coordinator.dart`) ‚Äî Runs preprocessing once per cycle, distributes `PreprocessedSignal` to algorithms
6. **UI Layer** ‚Äî Binds streams to widgets, displays consensus + per-algorithm results + PLP panel

## Key Files & Locations

- **Algorithms**: `lib/src/algorithms/` (simple_onset, autocorrelation, fft_spectrum, wavelet_energy)
- **DSP Utilities**: `lib/src/dsp/` (preprocessing.dart, fft_utils.dart, tempogram.dart, signal_utils.dart)
- **Consensus**: `lib/src/core/consensus_engine.dart`
- **Coordinator**: `lib/src/core/bpm_detector_coordinator.dart`
- **Test Fixtures**: `data/metronome_*.wav` files (55, 105, 155, 205 BPM)
- **Integration Tests**: `test/integration/` (metronome_wav_test.dart, etc.)
- **Documentation**: `docs/` (PLAN-03.md, algorithms.md, PROGRESS.md, architecture.md)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Synthetic signals for each algorithm
- **Integration Tests**: Real WAV fixtures under `data/` directory
  - Metronome suite: 55, 105, 155, 205 BPM
  - Tests use `percentTolerance` parameter for flexible accuracy bounds
- **Current Test Issue**: Wavelet tolerance not applying `percentTolerance` correctly; showing old fixed tolerance in failures
- **Validation Goal**: ‚â•90% of WAV fixtures within ¬±3 BPM for steady signals; ‚â•80% within ¬±5 BPM for complex signals

## Common Development Tasks

### Running Tests
```bash
flutter test                                    # All tests
flutter test test/integration/metronome_wav_test.dart  # Specific integration test
flutter analyze                                 # Static analysis
```

### Building for Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release                     # Release APK
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Adding Debug Prints
When debugging test issues (like current tolerance problem), add prints in test files or algorithm implementations to trace computed values during execution.

## PLAN-03 Roadmap (Accuracy Stabilization)

### Week 1 (Current): Interval & Harmonic Refinement
- ‚úÖ Histogram-based fundamental selector with duration weighting
- ‚úÖ Harmonic penalties for multipliers > 1
- ‚úÖ Autocorrelation and FFT histogram integration
- ‚úÖ Wavelet downsampling to 400 Hz
- üîç Next: Integrate Tempogram Toolbox bandwise spectral-flux novelty curve

### Week 2: Consensus Intelligence
- Metadata-weighted consensus scoring
- Confidence semantics refresh (High/Medium/Low tiers)
- PLP integration as auxiliary consensus source

### Week 3: Validation & Tooling
- Expand WAV fixture suite (steady metronome, live drum loop, electronic, tempo ramp, noise)
- CLI harness (`tool/bpm_wav_regression.dart`)
- CI integration with JSON/Markdown reporting

### Week 4: UX & Observability
- Display consensus confidence tier
- Show harmonic correction indicators
- Optional telemetry for field debugging

## Algorithm-Specific Notes

### SimpleOnsetAlgorithm
- Uses duration-squared histogram bins with aggressive harmonic penalties
- Fundamental tie-breakers favor slower buckets
- Confidence blends inter-beat variance with histogram agreement

### AutocorrelationAlgorithm
- Runs on onset envelope with calibrated confidence
- Histogram/clustering suppresses harmonic lags
- Lag ranges critical: set realistic minBpm/maxBpm bounds

### FftSpectrumAlgorithm
- Fundamental guard prevents 3/2 or 2√ó harmonic drift
- Ensure fftSize spans 8-12 seconds for sub-1 BPM resolution

### WaveletEnergyAlgorithm
- 400 Hz working rate, 2 levels (downsampled from 4 for performance)
- Literal tempo candidates (no harmonic expansion)
- Metadata captures aggregate/fallback logic for debugging
- **Current issue area**: tolerance handling in tests

## Collaboration Norms

1. Every major milestone/update should append an entry to `docs/PROGRESS.md` with owner + timestamp
2. When handing off work, note outstanding risks, artifacts, and verification steps
3. Reference PLAN-01/PLAN-03 requirements when proposing scope or architectural changes
4. Build-upload-test cycle is expensive; test locally and plan changes carefully

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Debug wavelet tolerance issue: add prints for computed allowed tolerance in tests
2. Integrate Predominant Pulse display properly in UI
3. Continue consensus algorithm improvements (metadata weighting)
4. Expand WAV fixture coverage beyond metronomes
